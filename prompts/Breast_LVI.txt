### **Task**  
You are a breast pathologist. Your task is to determine **whether lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is present** in the tumor, based solely on the text of the pathology report provided.


### **Expected Output Format**  
Return **exactly** one JSON object:

```json
{“LVI”: “<string>”, “reason”: “<string>”}
```

**Field constraints**
  - The value of "LVI" must be exactly one of: "Present", "Absent", or "Insufficient".
  - "Reason" can be any brief explanatory string (e.g., a direct quote or short justification).

### **Instructions** 
1. Scan for LVI terms: “lymphovascular (invasion/space)”, “LVSI/LVI”, “angiolymphatic invasion”, “tumor emboli in lymphatic or vascular spaces”, etc.

2. Classify
  - **Present** – any clear statement that LVI exists (including “focal”, “microscopic”, “rare”, etc.).
  - **Absent** – explicit negative wording (“absent”, “not identified”, “negative”, “none”, etc).
  - **Insufficient** – no LVI info or conflicting statements.  

3. Do not infer from other findings; use only explicit LVI statements.

4. Output exactly the JSON object—no additional keys, comments, or explanations.


### **Handling Missing or Ambiguous Data:**
If LVI cannot be determined because the report is missing, contradictory, or unclear, set LVI to "Insufficient".
